# ContentTools 2 roadmap

This repo exists for the discussion of new features for the next major release of ContentTools 2. 

## When will ContentTools 2 be available

This really depends on what features are agreed on in the roadmap for the initial release (2.0.0), I will be starting work on the new code base from March 2020 and I would like to have an initial new release out no later that Jan 2021.

## A note on ContentTools 1.x

ContentTools 1.x will continue to be updated with bug fixes and occassionally minor features (this includes the associated 1.x libraries - ContentEdit, ContentSelect, HTMLString, FMS), however, major new features such as adding support for new elements like `<picture>`, responsive UI support and allowing for multiple editor instances wont be ported back in to release 1.x.
