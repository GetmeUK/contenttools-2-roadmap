# ContentTools 2 roadmap

This repo exists for the discussion of new features for the next major release of ContentTools 2. 

## How do I request a feature?

Check if the feature you want has already been added to the issue list, if so simply upvote with a thumbs up (and add your own thoughts/opinions to enrich), if not open a new issue describing the feature you would like to see in ContentTools2.

## Which features are being included?

This is new so we're still reviewing new features and adding many of the ones we want to see. However, if a feature has made it in to the roadmap for ContentTools2 it will get a green **on roadmap** tag added to it (the associated milestone represents which release we plan to add it to starting from 2.0.0).

## When will ContentTools 2 be available

This really depends on what features are agreed on in the roadmap for the initial release (2.0.0), I will be starting work on the new code base from March 2020 and I would like to have an initial new release out no later that Jan 2021.

## A note on ContentTools 1.x

[ContentTools 1.x](https://github.com/GetmeUK/ContentTools) will continue to be updated with bug fixes and occassionally minor features (this includes the associated 1.x libraries - ContentEdit, ContentSelect, HTMLString, FMS), however, major new features such as adding support for new elements like `<picture>`, responsive UI support and allowing for multiple editor instances wont be ported back in to release 1.x.
